# eletromag Configuration

## Introduction
Welcome to the `eletromag` folder! This folder contains projects related to numerical analysis, physical modeling, and educational software development in the field of electromagnetics.

## Getting Started
To adapt the `eletromag` folder to your architecture, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `eletromag` folder in your preferred IDE.
3. Install any necessary dependencies specified in the project's documentation.
4. Build the projects according to the instructions provided in each project's README file.
5. Run the projects in your IDE's debugging environment.

## Project Structure
The `eletromag` folder is organized as follows:

- `project1`: Description of project 1.
- `project2`: Description of project 2.
- `project3`: Description of project 3.
- ...

Each project folder contains the necessary source code, documentation, and any additional files required to run the project.

## Multi-Code Features
Some projects in the `eletromag` folder may include multi-code features, which means that they can be executed using different programming languages (e.g., C, C++, Python). Please refer to each project's documentation for instructions on how to run the code in your preferred language.

## Running Without a Container
Since there is no container in the `eletromag` folder, it is important to note that iterations and other operations in C/C++ may not generate the exact same result on different architectures. However, the results should be similar.

## Additional Resources
For more information and detailed instructions on each project, please refer to the README files located in each project folder.

Happy coding!
